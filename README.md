### What matters to @solvaholic?

**Make messes you can clean up.** Then clean them up. This way you learn faster and avoid making messes other people have to clean up.

[**Being wrong feels exactly like being right.**](https://www.ted.com/talks/kathryn_schulz_on_being_wrong/transcript) So seek opportunities to verify or correct things you know and believe.

**Onymity.** I think ANonymity is for when an individual has things to say that other people need to hear and they donâ€™t feel safe being the messenger. Apart from that I believe we should communicate without hiding our identities, and without fear. Onymously.

**If youâ€™re going to make up a story, make up a story you like.** Weâ€™re each working with different, incomplete, and imperfect information. If youâ€™re going to draw conclusions and fill in blanks, tell a story you enjoy. Then youâ€™ll be happier and have more brainspace for things that really matter to you.

[**The serial comma.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) Effective communication is complicated and difficult. If using a comma before an "or" or "and" will eliminate some ambiguity then use the comma.

### What quirks does @solvaholic have?

One personâ€™s quirk is another personâ€™s norm. Here are a few of mine it may help for you to know about:

**I learn by doing and understanding.** If you want me to learn or do something, make it interactive and help me see how it will help solve a problem I care about.

**I donâ€™t multitask.** If you have my attention, you have all of it. Remember: With great power comes great responsibility.

**Iâ€™m a solvaholic.** I need a problem to solve in much the same way an alcoholic needs a drink and a junky needs more junk.

### What drives @solvaholic nuts? What are some telltale signs?

**Blame, closed-mindedness, and working without the objective in mind.** When I catch myself doing these things, or when I think you're doing them, I'll try to correct it or I'll stop participating.
